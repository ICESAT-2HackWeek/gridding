## Gridding and Filtering of Elevation Change Observations 

Instructor: Johan Nilsson (johan.nilsson@jpl.nasa.gov)

This tutorial focuses on the usefulness of different interpolation techniques and filtering approaches used in satellite altimetry to derive gridded products of elevation change. These products are then used to demonstrate how to derive the integrated volume change for the region in question. 


### Learning Objectives
- Understand different types of gridding techniques
- Understand the impact of different filtering strategies 
-
